Random Number Counter
Introduction
Welcome to the Random Number Counter application! This Java program generates random numbers and counts how many of them are greater than 99. The user can adjust the number of tries to customize the experiment.

Instructions
To run the code, press Run or click the Execute icon in the gutter. Make sure you have a Java development environment set up.

Usage
Adjust the number of tries by modifying the loop condition in the main method:
/*
for (int i = 1; i <= 100000000; i++) {
    //rest of MYY code heheh
}
*/
Debugging
To start debugging your code, press Debug. A breakpoint has been set, but you can add more by pressing ToggleLineBreakpoint.

Output
The program will print the count of numbers greater than 99 and display each qualifying random number with a sequential counter.

Example Output
/*
1. this number is bigger than 99: 100
2. this number is bigger than 99: 100
3. this number is bigger than 99: 100
*/
Note
Adjust the condition in the if statement if you want to change the threshold for considering a number.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs!
